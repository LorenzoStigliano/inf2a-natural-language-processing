			   John Barleycorn
			   ===============

                   There was three Kings into the east,
                      Three Kings both great and high,
                   And they hae sworn a solemn oath
                      John Barleycorn should die.

                   But cheerfu' Spring came kindly on,
                      And show'rs began to fall;
                   John Barleycorn got up again,
                      And sore surpris'd them all.

                   They took a plough and plough'd him down,
                      Put clods upon his head,
                   And they hae sworn a solemn oath
                      John Barleycorn was dead.
