Module descriptions:

Knowledge representation: this introduces the idea of
 representing knowledge and getting a computer to reason with that
knowledge, for example, being able to deduce new information from what
you already know. Simple rules are employed to demonstrate how some
kinds of knowledge, including uncertain knowledge, can be expressed
and used in reasoning.

Architectures: if you wanted to put together some kind of `smart'
agent such as an autonomous robot, you would have to bring together
various kinds of component in a coherent way. This introduces some
questions concerned with overall architecture, such as robustness,
reliability. maintainability and economy. It looks briefly at
symbolic, connectionist and behaviour-based architectures.
